Version 2.3 - 2014-12-21 Alexej Magura <agm2819*gmail*>
  * readline.setup:
    reverted back to v1.993 setup; added checks to see if <bsd/string.h> is present and if `strlcat' is provided by `-lbsd'

Version 2.2 - 2014-12-20 Alexej Magura <agm2819*gmail*>

  * readline-egg.c:
    (include): added `<stdbool.h>'
    (#define): added some more macros; most of which probably aren't used...
    (balance_t): changed `paren' and `brace' to arrays of integers with a size of 3 (e.g. `int paren[3]`)
    (strtail_addr): added a function that returns the memory address of a string's tail (i.e. `&string[strlen(string) - 1]`)
    (strend_addr): added another function; this one returns the memory address of the terminating null in a string.
    (prev_char): added a function that takes a string pointer and a string and peeks at the previous char, if any, without messing the pointer up.
    (ptr_strhead): added a function that tells you if the string pointer is pointing to the memory address of the first char in `string'
    (ptr_not_strhead): added a function that calls `!ptr_strhead`.
    (quote_in_string): added a function that finds the number of `"` in a string and tells you if they're balanced or not.
    (clear_parbar): (horrible name, I know).  sets each `int' in the `balance.paren' and `balance.brace' arrays to `0'.
    (parbar_in_string): finds the balance of `(' vs `)' or `[' vs `]' in a string; replaces `key_balance' with some help from `quote_in_string'.

  * readline-egg.c: fixed several bugs with the unclosed-expression-prompt.

  * extra/test.bats: added some tests written in `bats' that help test for bugs that are harder to catch inside of scheme, since they happen at the REPL.
